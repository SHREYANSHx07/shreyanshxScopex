```

### Database Schema

#### User Model (Custom)
- Extends Django's AbstractUser
- Adds role field (admin, manager, user)
- Profile picture and additional fields
- Role-based property methods

#### Project Model
- Project information and status tracking
- Many-to-many relationship with users
- Progress calculation methods
- Status choices with workflow

#### Task Model
- Task assignment and tracking
- Foreign key to Project and User
- Priority and status management
- Due date tracking with overdue detection

#### Additional Models
- UserProfile: Extended user information
- TaskComment: Task collaboration

### Security Implementation

#### Authentication
- Custom User model with role-based access
- JWT authentication for API endpoints
- Session-based authentication for web interface
- Password validation and security

#### Authorization
- Role-based decorators (@admin_required, @manager_required)
- View-level permission checking
- Template-based role rendering
- Dynamic menu based on permissions
